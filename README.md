# ProfitBot
A java program to (hopefully) automate investing for easy profit. Input a stock and starting amount of cash and watch the program run an investment simulation!

Run the Driver.java file to get started. Driver uses args[] to operate. The necessary arguments are (in order): 1) The symbol of the stock you want to analyze. The stock must be downloaded as a csv from Yahoo Finance's webpage (samples are included). Do not include the ".csv" at the end, only the symbol (Example: Boeing -> "BA" not "BA.csv"). 2) Starting cash. Start with higher amounts for more stable results. 3) Threshold value. If the chaos index exceeds this threshold, a share will be purchased. Chaos indexes are a rating for a stock's buyability and subsequently determine how the program purchases shares. Higher chaos indexes represent a stock more recommended to purchase. The higher the threshold, the more conservative the program will be to purchase. 

This is obviously a work in progress! I plan on changing the chaos index algorithm dramatically as I learn more numeric investing strategies.
